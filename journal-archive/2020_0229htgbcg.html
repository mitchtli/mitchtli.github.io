        <h2> Hack the Globe 2020: Notes </h2>
        <p>
        Currently, at this point in time, I'm very much interested in pursuing a career in management consulting, more specifically, in strategy. From the complex business problems that reward intellectual curiousity, to the money, prestige, and long working hours for my workaholic needs, everything about the management consulting lifestyle seemed perfect for me. And by volunteering with Hack the Globe, I realized just how much more I wanted to be a consultant and just how unready (at age 20) I was to be one.
          <br><br>
        Today (February 29th, 2020) I woke up at 5 A.M. to take a bus to Downtown Toronto. Even in the early morning, I knew I looked good, so I felt good; I had a feeling that everything was going to be great.
          <br><br>
        And it did end up being a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to work with and talk to some amazing people. Regardless of whether they were sponsor representatives, fellow hackathon volunteers, or hackathon participants, I am certain to say I learned a little something from everyone I talked to.
