        <h2> Lessons Learned from Hack the Globe 2020 </h2>
        <p>
          <br><br>
        Today (February 29th, 2020), I woke up at 5 A.M. to take a bus to Downtown Toronto. Even in the early morning, I knew I looked good, so I felt good; I had a feeling that everything was going to be great.
          <br><br>
        And it did end up being a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to work with and talk to some amazing people. Regardless of whether they were sponsor representatives, fellow hackathon volunteers, or hackathon participants, I am certain to say I learned a little something from everyone I interacted with.
        <br>
        <br>
        Specifically from the first year hacker that I talked to, I realized just how capable we all are if we just honed in on what we wished to accomplish. From talking to him, I could tell from the sound of his voice and his mannerisms that he was very nervous; however, it reminded me very much of my first networking event just a little more than a year ago. Being on the opposite side of 'networking' for once, thank you for making me realize just how far I've come since then.
        <br>
        <br>
        From working alongside Boston Consulting Group (BCG) consultants and associates in putting the event together, I realized that the consulting industry is one based on humility and respect with no space for arrogance and selfishness. Thank you for appreciating my presence and for complimenting my meager contributions. The privilege of working with you has truly been an honour and thank you for making me realize what I'm lacking in character. I will continue to aspire to incorporate the values you have shown towards me in my quests in life.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you Global Engineering Week for the amazing opportunity. Cheers to many more lessons to be learned.
